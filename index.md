## Something about myself to get started

Hello, my name is Raymond Cheng, I am currently a student in USF pursuing my BS degree in Computer Engineering. I decided to make this website to host some of my past projects that I have done while learning how to use Github in general. So far I am still really confused with some stuff but I'm trying my best to at least learn something new everyday and try to update this website as I learn more stuff, thanks for coming by and have a great day!
